    "# Python Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Data Types\n",
    "- Literals - (10) and it's types - (int)\n",
    "- Binary (0,1) - Machine language\n",
    "- Integers\n",
    "- Floats - not exact values\n",
    "- Binary(base 2) to Intergers and Floats(base 10) conversion\n",
    "- Intergers and Floats(base 10) to Binary(base 2) conversion\n",
    "- Output representation is always a string\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "- Everything in Python is a object\n",
    "- Python compiles the Literal - (10) and creates a (Integer) Object that has 10 as it's state\n",
    "- Entity: Anything that exists in code (Class, object, variable, literal, etc.)\n",
    "- Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. it defines State: The data attributes that each object will hold. Methods: The behaviors (functions) that operate on that data.\n",
    "- Object: An entity created from a class, with state and methods\n",
    "- In Python, objects can already exist or can be created\n",
    "#### Objects That Already Exist\n",
    "  - Literals like 10, 3.14, \"hello\", True, None\n",
    "  - Built-in types like int, str, list, dict, bool\n",
    "  - Functions like print(), len(), type()\n",
    "  - Classes like object, Exception, int, str\n",
    "#### Objects You Create\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "p = Person(\"Alice\")  # Creates a new Person object\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Python `(objects)` have `State(data/literals) and methods(functionality-can have parameters) are Atributes` called Encapsulation \n",
    "> Example: `object with type Integer` have `Value` and `.__add__(Parameter) `\n",
    "- `Encapsulation` means grouping related data and method together inside a class, and `controlling access` to that data.\n",
    "- Dot notation to access attributes of an object\n",
    "- Mutable Data Types(attributes/internal state can be changed) and Immutable Data Types(internal state cannot be changed)\n",
    "-  State: Refers to the internal data stored in an object. It can change over time as methods are called\n",
    "-  Method: is a function that can access and modify the object’s state.\n",
    "> Example: `(10).__add__(100) = 110`\n",
    "> \n",
    "> `(state).__Method__(Parameter)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "- Naming objects/labels/symbols\n",
    "- `=` Assignment Operator, assigns/references/points the object to a label/variable\n",
    "> balance = 1_000.00\n",
    "- Python compiles the Literal - (10) and creates a (Integer) Object in the memory that has 10 as it's state\n",
    "> x = 10\n",
    "-  when we label that object as `x`, then x refrences  that object 10\n",
    "-  python evaluates RHS first then assigns the result to LHS.\n",
    "> x = 'shiva'\n",
    "- References can change over time, we can point the x to 'shiva' now.\n",
    "- Objects like `lists` are mutable(object's state can be appended/changed), but the reference didn't change here.\n",
    "> x = float(10)\n",
    "- This will create a float object\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Variable Names\n",
    "- case sensitive\n",
    "- Must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or underscore _ or unicode characters\n",
    "- Can contain letters, digits, and underscores\n",
    "- Cannot start with a digit\n",
    "- Cannot use Python keywords (like class, def, if, else, etc.)\n",
    "- Use descriptive names: total_price, user_name\n",
    "- Use snake_case for variables: user_age, is_valid for variables and CamelCase: AccountBalance, accountBalance for Classes\n",
    "- Constants are usually written in UPPER_CASE: PI = 3.14\n",
    "- Avoid single-letter names unless in loops: i, j\n",
    "- SyntaxError: Invalid Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "- Arithmetic, Comparsion/Relational/membership/Boolean, logical Operators\n",
    "- Operator acts on Operands(values)\n",
    "- Unary(1 operand), Binary(2 operand), Ternary(3 operand) Operator\n",
    "> -10\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 10*20\n",
    "- Python has dunder methods can be used instead of operators. Example: `__add__`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opertor Precedence\n",
    "- binary(+, - ) <-- (*, / ) <-- unary(+, -) <-- (**)\n",
    "> ` -2**4 = -(2**4) = -16`\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ` 2**-3 = 2**(-3) = 0.125`\n",
    "- Use Paranthesis to avoid errors\n",
    "- Python follows PEDMAS - Parentheses (),Exponents ** , Multiplication *, Division / gives full output in float, Floor Division // truncates to nearest largest integer,   Modulus % gives remainder  , Addition +, Subtraction -\n",
    "- Comparsion operator result will be boolean\n",
    "- Note: a = 5 and b = 5.0 and c = 5, d = 500 and e = 500 are same value, but they are different objects- integer object and float object\n",
    "> a == b = TRUE\n",
    "> \n",
    "> d == e = TRUE\n",
    "- we are comparing value, not the object, as everything is an object in python, to cpmare objects we use `is`\n",
    "> a is b = FALSE\n",
    "> \n",
    "> a is c = TRUE\n",
    "> \n",
    "> a is a = TRUE  # this is beacuse python for small integers does optimization and reuses same value for multiple objects\n",
    "> \n",
    "> d is e = FALSE # d and e are stored as different objects in memory\n",
    "- `is` operator is for memory address(identity) of the objetcs\n",
    "- `==` operator is for state(value) of the objects, so we use `==` instead of `is` for comparisons most of the time.\n",
    "- `id(a)` to find memory address\n",
    "- `in` and `not in` are memberhip operators\n",
    "- `TRUE` and `FALSE` are boolean operators\n",
    "- `not` is unary logical operator gives reverse of boolean value and `or`,`and` are logical operators and short circuited evaluation"
